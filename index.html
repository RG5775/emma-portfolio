            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Emma — someone who doesn't just learn, but absorbs, dissects, and restructures. 
                To me, every new skill is a puzzle piece waiting to click into a bigger picture.

                My background weaves together math, biochemistry, accounting, and data analytics
                 — a blend that lets me see systems from both the micro and macro level. Whether it's building dashboards, optimizing workflows, or uncovering hidden patterns in data, I'm always driven by the urge to make complex things clear and meaningful.
